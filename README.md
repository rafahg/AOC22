# Advent of Code 2022

## Scope

Solve as many challenges as possible from [Advent of Code 2022](https://external.ink?to=/adventofcode.com)

## Goals and programming Languages

The idea is to solve as many challenges as possible using Apex and and Salesforce Org to display the results.
Also as a mid goal bonus I would try the challenges as well in JS and using LWC to show the results in the org, to practice LWC functionalities like picklists, modals, search for results, etc....
